# Collision-Aware-Needle-Path-Planning
Automated collision-aware needle path planning for image-guided interventions using CT/MRI and tumor segmentation. The pipeline generates, filters, and ranks safe insertion paths based on geometric and clinical constraints, recommends suitable ablation needles, and supports 3D visualization for validation.
